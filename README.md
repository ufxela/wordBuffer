# Word Buffer
Just a random, fun project that I made to learn some python and play around. 

Ever wish you could juice up your vocabulary but not need to put in the effort of learning new words?
Well, lucky for you, **Word Buffer** is just what you need! Often compared to the anabolic steroids of 
the writing industry, **Word Buffer** will be sure to buff you up without teaching you anything but to cheat!

To use, just run `python wordBuffer.py` and follow the CLI instructions!
